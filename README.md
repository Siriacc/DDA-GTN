DDA-GTN
==
In this work, we first present a benchmark dataset that includes three entities: drugs, genes, and diseases that form a three-layer heterogeneous network, and introduce Graph Transformers Networks to learn the low-dimensional embedded representations of drugs-diseases in the heterogeneous network as a way to predict drug-disease associations. We named this method DDA-GTN.
