# DDA-GTN
In this work, we used Graph Transformers Networks  to predict the interactions between drug and disease. Under the 'data' folder, there are two folders 'raw_data' and 'generated_data', which provide the raw dataset and the data generated for our method, respectively. 'src/dataset_settings.ini' is a parameter configuration file for each dataset.
